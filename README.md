# 🚢🤖 Titanic Machine Learning 

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. <br/>
The project uses a dataset of passengers to build and test predictive models.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes two files:
- `titanic_train.csv`: Training data for building the model.
- `titanic_test.csv`: Test data for evaluating the model.

## 📂 Files

- `Assignment2_supervised_learning_flow.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data processing and model training.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived based on:
- Age 👶
- Gender 👩‍🦰👨‍🦱
- Passenger class 🛳️
- Fare 💸
